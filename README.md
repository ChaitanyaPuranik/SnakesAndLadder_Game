Snake and Ladder game is a traditional game that involves two or more players and the winner is the guy who reaches the final square on the game board at the earliest.

Rules of the Game: 

Players take turns rolling the die and move their token forward by the number that appears on the top of the die. For example, if a player rolls a 3, they move three squares forward.
If a player lands on a square with the base of a ladder, then they must climb the ladder to the square which is at the top of the ladder.
If a player lands on the square in which there is a mouth of a snake then the player must slide down to the square which is at the snakeâ€™s tail.
Players take the turn clockwise and the game terminates until one player reaches the final square. If a player rolls a number that counts past the final square, then the player must wait until their next turn to try again.
The first player to reach the final square is declared the winner.
